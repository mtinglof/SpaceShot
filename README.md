# Space Shot
> A 2D Game Designed in Unity 

This 2D simple target shooting game was designed for a Game Design class taken at San Diego State University. It is a project designed to get my toes wet in the game design world. 

## Installing / Getting started

If you would like to play just the game, an installer can be found in 

```
GameInHere/Windows/Installer
```
From there you can run the installer wizard to get your very own copy of Space Shot. 

## Developing

If you would like to developed the game further, I recommend downloading a copy of Unity and downloading or forking my repository for cloning. 

## Features

The game is rather simple and includes only a few scenes.
